## Challenge:

#### Context:
House Rocket is a digital platform whose business model is the purchase and sale of real estate using technology.
You are a Data Scientist hired by the company to help you find the best business opportunities in the real estate market. House Rocket's CEO would like to maximize the company's revenue by finding good business opportunities.
Your main strategy is to buy good houses in great locations at low prices and then resell them later at higher prices. The greater the difference between buying and selling, the greater the company's profit and therefore the greater its revenue.
However, homes have many attributes that make them more or less attractive to buyers and sellers, and location and time of year can also influence prices.

#### Questions:
01. What houses should the CEO of House Rocket buy and at what purchase price?
2. Once the house is owned by the company, what is the best time to sell them and what would be the sale price?
3. Should House Rocket do a renovation to raise the sale price? What would be the suggestions for changes? What is the price increase given for each refurbishment option?
